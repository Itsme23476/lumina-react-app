      <p>
        <strong style={{ color: '#fff' }}>Local AI</strong> — artificial intelligence that runs entirely on your own device, without sending data to the cloud — is one of the most significant shifts happening in consumer software right now. Unlike the AI tools most people are familiar with (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini), <strong style={{ color: '#fff' }}>local AI software for desktop</strong> processes everything on your machine's own CPU or GPU. No server. No subscription. No privacy tradeoff.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2026, local AI has become practical for everyday users for the first time. Hardware has caught up. Models have been optimized dramatically. And the use cases that benefit most from local processing — personal file search, document analysis, private note organization — are exactly the kind of tasks that shouldn't be routed through someone else's cloud in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
        This guide covers what local AI actually means technically, how it compares to cloud AI in practical terms, what hardware you need to run it, and the specific applications where it's already beating the cloud alternatives.
      </p>

      {/* ── Section 1 ── */}
      <h2 style={h2Style}>What Is Local AI and How Does It Differ from Cloud AI?</h2>
      <p>
        The distinction is architectural. <strong style={{ color: '#fff' }}>Cloud AI</strong> sends your input (text, files, images) to a remote server, where a model processes it and returns a result. The model lives on the server. Your device is just a terminal. This is how ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and most consumer AI products work.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong style={{ color: '#fff' }}>Local AI</strong> runs the model directly on your hardware. When you run a local AI tool, the model is downloaded to your machine, and inference (the actual computation) happens locally. Your data doesn't leave your device at any point in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        This distinction has profound practical implications for speed, privacy, cost, and availability. A cloud AI tool requires an active internet connection and incurs latency proportional to the roundtrip network time. A local AI tool can return results faster than a network connection could even be established, and it works completely offline.
      </p>
      <h3 style={h3Style}>What kinds of models run locally?</h3>
      <p>
        Frontier models like GPT-4 or Gemini Ultra have hundreds of billions of parameters and require data center-grade hardware to run. These will likely remain cloud-only for years. But a wide range of highly capable smaller models — in the 1 to 13 billion parameter range — can run efficiently on consumer hardware in 2026. These models are more than capable enough for practical tasks like document understanding, file classification, and semantic search.
      </p>

      {/* ── Section 2 ── */}
      <h2 style={h2Style}>Why Local AI Is Finally Practical in 2026</h2>
      <p>
        Three things converged to make local AI genuinely useful for everyday users:
      </p>
      <h3 style={h3Style}>1. Hardware acceleration became mainstream</h3>
      <p>
        Apple's M-series chips from 2020 onward include dedicated Neural Engine hardware that can run AI inference tasks dramatically faster than a general-purpose CPU. More recently, AMD's Ryzen AI and Intel's Core Ultra series brought similar neural processing units to Windows laptops at mainstream price points. If you bought a mid-to-high-end laptop in 2024 or later, you almost certainly have dedicated AI hardware in it.
      </p>
      <h3 style={h3Style}>2. Quantization made models tiny without destroying quality</h3>
      <p>
        Early AI models required 32-bit floating point precision, which made them massive. Research into quantization — reducing model weights to 4-bit or 8-bit integers — has produced models that are 4x to 8x smaller with only marginal quality loss on practical tasks. A model that required 48GB of VRAM in 2023 can now run in 6GB. That's the difference between requiring an A100 GPU and running on a MacBook Pro.
      </p>
      <h3 style={h3Style}>3. The open-source ecosystem matured</h3>
      <p>
        The release of Meta's LLaMA models in 2023 triggered an explosion of open-source AI development. By 2026, there are high-quality, openly licensed models for nearly every task: text understanding, image analysis, code generation, semantic search. The infrastructure to run these models efficiently (llama.cpp, Ollama, MLX on Apple Silicon) has become stable and user-friendly. Developers can build local AI applications without building their own inference engines.
      </p>

      {/* ── Section 3 ── */}
      <h2 style={h2Style}>What Hardware Do You Need to Run Local AI?</h2>
      <p>
        This is the question most people wonder about first. The answer depends on what you're running:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong style={{ color: '#fff' }}>For AI-powered file search (like Filect):</strong> Almost any computer from 2020 onward. File indexing and semantic search use relatively small embedding models (under 500MB) that run comfortably with 8GB of RAM and any modern CPU. No dedicated GPU required.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong style={{ color: '#fff' }}>For running small language models (7B parameters):</strong> 16GB of RAM recommended, with Apple Silicon or a recent AMD/Intel AI-capable CPU providing the best experience. A mid-range gaming GPU (RTX 3060 or better) on Windows also works well.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong style={{ color: '#fff' }}>For running larger models (13B–34B parameters):</strong> 24GB+ VRAM NVIDIA GPU, or high-memory Apple Silicon (M2 Pro/Max/Ultra or later). This is enthusiast territory and not required for most practical use cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong style={{ color: '#fff' }}>The baseline summary:</strong> For the most common local AI use cases in 2026 — file search, document summarization, private note organization — a standard laptop or desktop from the last three years is sufficient. You don't need to buy anything new.

      <h2 style={h2Style}>The Best Use Cases for Local AI on a Personal Computer</h2>
      <p>
        Local AI isn't the right tool for every task. But for a specific category of applications — ones that touch your most personal data, require low latency, or need to work offline — it's clearly superior to cloud alternatives.
      </p>
      <h3 style={h3Style}>1. AI-powered file search and organization</h3>
      <p>
        This is arguably the strongest use case for local AI today. Your files are deeply personal — medical records, financial documents, private correspondence. Indexing them locally and making them searchable with natural language is something that should never require uploading your data to another company's server. Local AI embedding models do this task excellently with modest hardware requirements. This is exactly what Filect does — and why we built it local-first.

      </p>
      <h3 style={h3Style}>2. Private document analysis</h3>
      <p>
        Legal documents, contracts, financial reports, medical records — anything you'd hesitate before pasting into ChatGPT. Local AI lets you query these documents intelligently without any exposure risk.
      </p>
      <h3 style={h3Style}>3. Code assistance for proprietary codebases</h3>
      <p>
        Many organizations prohibit sending source code to external APIs. Local code assistant models (Deepseek Coder, Code Llama, etc.) provide nearly competitive autocomplete and explanation capabilities without violating any data policies.
      </p>
      <h3 style={h3Style}>4. Personal knowledge base and note search</h3>
      <p>
        Running a local embedding model over thousands of notes, saved articles, and research documents creates a personal search engine that understands content — not just filenames. The experience is meaningfully better than keyword search across note-taking apps.
      </p>
      <h3 style={h3Style}>5. Offline AI assistant for travel or restricted environments</h3>
      <p>
        On a plane, in a rural area, or in a secure facility without internet — local AI keeps working. For professionals who travel frequently or work in restricted network environments, offline capability is a hard requirement.

      {/* ── Section 6 ── */}
      <h2 style={h2Style}>Privacy and Local AI: What "No Cloud" Actually Means</h2>
      <p>
        The phrase "no data leaves your device" gets used in marketing a lot. It's worth being precise about what it actually means — and how to verify it.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a local AI tool makes this claim, it means that the input (your files, your queries) is never transmitted to a remote server. The model runs on your own CPU/GPU. The index it builds lives on your own storage. No third party ever has access to any of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can verify this independently: run the application in a network-isolated environment (airplane mode, or with a firewall blocking its outbound connections) and confirm it still functions fully. A genuinely local AI tool will work perfectly offline because its core functionality doesn't depend on any network connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        This matters most for the files that AI is best at helping with: financial documents, legal agreements, medical records, private correspondence. These are exactly the files you don't want uploaded to anyone else's infrastructure, however well-intentioned.
      </p>

      {/* ── Section 7 ── */}
      <h2 style={h2Style}>The Limitations of Local AI (and When Cloud Is Still Better)</h2>
      <p>
        Honest comparison requires acknowledging limitations. Local AI isn't the right tool for every situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong style={{ color: '#fff' }}>Task complexity.</strong> For highly complex reasoning tasks — analyzing massive datasets, generating sophisticated long-form content, processing multi-modal inputs (text + images + audio simultaneously) — frontier cloud models still significantly outperform local alternatives. GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro are genuinely more capable than any locally runnable model in 2026 for hard reasoning tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong style={{ color: '#fff' }}>Hardware requirements for large tasks.</strong> If you want to run a model large enough to rival cloud quality (70B+ parameters), you need a machine with 64GB+ of RAM or a high-end GPU. That's a significant hardware investment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong style={{ color: '#fff' }}>Initial setup complexity.</strong> While tools like Ollama have improved usability dramatically, setting up local AI still requires more technical comfort than using a cloud product. For non-technical users, applications that abstract this complexity (like Filect) are the more accessible path into local AI.
      </p>

      {/* ── Section 8 ── */}
      <h2 style={h2Style}>What to Expect from Local AI in 2027 and Beyond</h2>
      <p>
        The trajectory of local AI in the next 12–24 months points in a clear direction: more capable, more accessible, more integrated.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong style={{ color: '#fff' }}>Faster hardware.</strong> Apple Silicon roadmap continues toward higher memory bandwidth and more powerful Neural Engines. AMD's next-gen NPUs will push AI performance significantly. Intel's Lunar Lake and its successors bring more capable AI acceleration to thin-and-light laptops.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong style={{ color: '#fff' }}>Better model efficiency.</strong> Research into quantization and model distillation is moving fast. Models that require 16GB today will require 4GB in two years at similar quality levels. The hardware ceiling is dropping every cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong style={{ color: '#fff' }}>OS-level integration.</strong> Apple's Apple Intelligence and Microsoft Copilot+ are early signals that local AI processing will become a first-class feature of operating systems. In 2027, "does this run locally?" may have the same answer for AI as "does this run offline?" has for most apps today: yes, by default.
      </p>

      {/* ── FAQ ── */}
      <h2 style={h2Style}>FAQ: Local AI on Desktop</h2>
      <div style={faqItemStyle}>
        <h3 style={{ ...h3Style, marginTop: 0 }}>What is the difference between local AI and on-device AI?</h3>
        <p>These terms are used interchangeably. Both refer to AI processing that happens on the user's own hardware rather than on a remote cloud server. "On-device" is more common in mobile contexts (smartphones, tablets); "local AI" is more common in the desktop and server context.</p>
      </div>
      <div style={faqItemStyle}>
        <h3 style={{ ...h3Style, marginTop: 0 }}>Does running local AI slow down my computer?</h3>
        <p>During active inference (when the model is processing a query), local AI uses CPU, GPU, or NPU resources meaningfully. For brief tasks like search queries, this is imperceptible on modern hardware. For sustained tasks like generating long text, you'll see resource usage climb. Most local AI tools are designed to release resources when idle.</p>
      </div>
      <div style={faqItemStyle}>
        <h3 style={{ ...h3Style, marginTop: 0 }}>What is the best local AI model for file search?</h3>
        <p>For file search specifically, you don't need a large language model at all — you need a good embedding model. The best options in 2026 include nomic-embed-text, all-MiniLM-L6-v2, and BGE-M3. These models are small (under 1GB), fast, and produce high-quality semantic embeddings for document content.</p>
      </div>
      <div style={faqItemStyle}>
        <h3 style={{ ...h3Style, marginTop: 0 }}>Is local AI better for privacy than cloud AI?</h3>
        <p>Yes, categorically. Cloud AI sends your data to a third party's servers. No matter how strong the provider's privacy policy is, you are trusting them to handle your data appropriately. Local AI never sends your data anywhere — it physically cannot be accessed by the model provider because the computation happens on your machine.</p>
      </div>
      <div style={{ ...faqItemStyle, borderBottom: 'none', marginBottom: 0, paddingBottom: 0 }}>
        <h3 style={{ ...h3Style, marginTop: 0 }}>Can I use local AI without coding experience?</h3>
        <p>Yes, increasingly so. Applications like Filect bring local AI to specific use cases (file search and organization) without requiring any technical setup. For more general-purpose local AI, tools like Ollama with an interface like Open WebUI make it accessible to non-developers. The learning curve is dropping rapidly as the ecosystem matures.</p>
